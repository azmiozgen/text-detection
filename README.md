# text-detection

This project aims to detect text regions in images using only image processing techniques with MSER (Maximally Stable Extremal Regions) and SWT (Stroke Width Transform).  And also [Tesseract-OCR](https://opensource.google.com/projects/tesseract.)
tool is used optionally, as assistance to the algorithm.

## INSTALLING

Use `Python>=3.11`

Install requirements with pip

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

For OCR assistance, install Tesseract from package manager

`sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`

## USAGE

Basic usage is

`python detect.py -i <input-image>`

You can give output file

`python detect.py -i assets/scenetext01.jpg -o <output-image>`

More options available

`python detect.py -i assets/scenetext01.jpg -o <output-file> -d <light,dark,both,both+> -t`

Option *-i* is image path, *-o* is output path, *-d* is SWT direction (default is `both+`), *-t* option chooses if Tesseract will be used. Normally Tesseract runs poorly if whole image given as input.
But it is used as final decision of bounding boxes.

If you want to give whole image to Tesseract to see the impact of the algorithm, try this.

`python detect.py -i assets/scenetext01.jpg -f`

For more detail (seeing intermediate steps), the usage given below is also available.

`python detect.py -i assets/scenetext01.jpg -d both+ -t --details`
